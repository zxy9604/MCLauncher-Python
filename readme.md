Sync for mods of Minecraft
---------------------------
##Motivation
There are many minecraft servers today.  
Although maintaining a server is not hard, there are still some problems when concentrating the interaction with users.   

For instance, as a curious one, I would always be interested in finding some new mods, but distributing them to users is quite a huge problem; I have to notify everyone, moreover, I need to help them to load those mods, since they do not really have any idea of where they should put them in.

Thus, I decided to make a tool to accomplish the synchronization of mods between clients and server.

##Environment
